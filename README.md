Dividends Buy Stuff
===================

This is an exploration of using Ramda and Q to solve a problem I made up.

The problem is to pick some consumer products, and figure out how much to invest in shares of the manufacturer for ~1 year of dividends to cover the cost of buying the product (instead of more shares). 

* There are asynchronous calls to the Yahoo Finance API which is an excuse to use Q
* This could be solved in a functional-ish style using Ramda, so why not?
